Shopping cart example app
=========================

This is a simple iOS app that demonstrates the functionality of a shopping cart.

This project uses [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) for managing its dependencies. So make sure you open ShoppingCartExample.xcworkspace. 

If you are new to **CocoaPods**, I recommend this [explanation](http://nshipster.com/cocoapods/).
